## 👋 About Me

I’m a passionate backend developer driven by curiosity, innovation, and a love for turning wild ideas into real-world solutions.
- 💻 I specialize in **Laravel**, REST APIs, and everything database—building robust, scalable systems that don’t just work, they thrive.
- 📝 Documentation, testing, and architecture come naturally: Swagger, Postman, design patterns, and scalable DBs are my daily tools.
- 🤓 I believe real code is read more than written—so I craft clean, maintainable code my future self will thank me for!
- 🎯 **My Mission:** Deliver clarity, reliability, and a bit of magic to every API, endpoint, and service I build.

## 🔥 What Drives Me

- 🛠️ **Craftsmanship**: I fix things that are broken and improve things that work
- 🕶️ **Creativity**: I prototype and refactor until it's clean, fast, and fun
- 🚧 **Always In Beta**: I never stop learning—Next.js, MongoDB, and more in my pipeline
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: APIs should be self-explanatory and a joy to build against
- 🧩 **Challenge Seeker**: I enjoy debugging, scalability puzzles, and turning “impossible” into “shipped”
